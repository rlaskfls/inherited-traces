    <h4 class="fade">I have a crescent-shaped birthmark on my left wrist that has been there since I was a baby. 
        As a child, I would trace its curve with my finger, imagining it was a moon glowing just for me. 
        Around age eight, I started to see it as my own little symbol of luck, believing it brought me good fortune. 
        Now, every time I catch a glimpse of it, I smile, remembering those carefree days of imagination.
