    <h4 class="fade">My birthmark is a jagged line that stretches across my left shoulder, 
        a bold streak of color that has been there since birth. Growing up, 
        I called it my “warrior mark,” as it felt like a badge of honor. 
        In high school, when I faced challenges—friend drama or tough exams—I would touch it for comfort. 
        It became my reminder of resilience, a unique part of my story.
