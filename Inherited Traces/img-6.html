    <h4 class="fade">I have a star-shaped mole on the front side of my neck that's been there for as long as I can remember. 
        When I was a kid, I used to imagine it was a little star shining just for me, a secret constellation hidden on my skin. 
        I loved to tell my friends it was my own personal star, and I'd make up stories about how it guided me through life's adventures.
