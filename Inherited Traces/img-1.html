    <h4 class="fade">I have a heart-shaped mole on my right arm that has been with me for as long as I can remember. 
        As I grew, the mole transformed, becoming darker and more pronounced, 
        almost like a little tattoo. 
        I was around 12 when I first noticed its heart shape, and it struck me as something special. 
        It felt like a secret that only I knew, a tiny emblem of love nestled on my skin.
