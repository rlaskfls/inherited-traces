    <h4 class="fade">I have a small, dark mole on the left side of my neck that feels like a little secret I carry with me. 
        Growing up, I would often touch it absentmindedly, finding comfort in its presence. 
        I remember being about ten when my best friend pointed it out, calling it my “beauty mark.” 
        At first, I was shy about it, but as I embraced that nickname, it started to feel special—like a part of my identity.
